            <h2>About Zest</h2>
            <p>Zest is dedicated to curating safe community focused events, centering BIPOC folks/creatives that are ready to participate in their local community. Brought to you with accountability, authenticity, friendship, love, and respect in mind. Aiming to see it reflected back in our neighborhoods.<br><br>
Since Zest first began its monthly commitment to organizing the local community in 2022, weâ€™ve had the pleasure of showcasing 104 small business vendors, 34 music artists/bands, and connected with a multitude of creatives in general. With events spanning from small business markets, local music artist lineups, tattoo flash, collaging, trading posts, film, stamp making, and so much more to come! Popping up in our favorite cities, Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco and finding people who reflect the world at large throughout.
